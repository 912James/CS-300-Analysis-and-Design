Module 8 Journal 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For project 1, we were instructed to create a document that contained the previous modules Pseudocode and make any necessary changes to ensure we were meeting the clients requirements. The Pseudocode included Vectors, Hash Table and Binary Search Tree Data Structures that contained how to open and read a file, create object structures, and print course information and prerequisites. We were then instructed to create pseudocode for a menu that performed specific tasks, such as load the data structure, print a list of the courses, print a specific course and its prerequisites that the user elected and finally an option to exit the program. Lastly we were instructed to evaluate the run-time and memory of each data structure and detail each advanatage or disadvantage the structures had. I finished project 1 by making a recommendation of what data structure I believed worked best and that i would be utilizing in project 2. For project 2 we were instructed to design code that would use our elected data structure to read the course data file, in my case it was an excel file, then load the data file into the data structure. From there the code with give the user a menu where they had the options of laoding the data structure, printing the course list, printing a specific course and prerequisites and exiting the program. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

For project 1, I utilized my new understading of how pseudocode worked with data structures and implemented that into the course requirements for the project. When it came time to do the evaluation of the run-time of each data structure i used the pseudocode from the previous modules to help fill out the form and create my analysis. FOr project 2, i utilzied the code from module 5-3 binary search tree and made the necessary changes to accomodate the project. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I did not encounter any roadblocks in project one due to having previous weeks of activities and zybooks to look upon while completing the project. For project 2, i also did not encounter any roadblocks that affected the outcome of the project. I did try to make changes to the code to make it visually look a certain way and made numerous changes to the code to see the different reactions when the code was run until i ultimately decided how i wanted the end code to look like. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has given me more confidence when i am writing code. Comparing each semester and how my comfort level and understanding of the different objects, syntax, loops, if statements, etc. has increased has continued my development into becoming a better developer. ( if i could even call myself that) During this project i wanted to expand how my menu looked to the user, so i played around with different code to see how each implemenation would look and run. To format the output of what the user would see i used setw() in my cout statement. I tried utilizing different techniques to get the input and display different outputs. Ultimately I found a good balance of clean readbale code, while displaying the requirements for the project but also giving me the confidence that i was able to make multiple changes and still have a program that ran as expected.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

What i have come to realize the more i code is that most of the time spent coding involves problem solving or debugging. So far i have been coding small sections at a time to ensure it works and then i move onto the next section. The more code i write the more confident i have become which ultimately has helped me complete the projects and any course material without any major issues. I also finished learn c++ on codecadamy.com during this semester which also helped me further understand more about C++ and allowed me the ability to use some of what i learned in the activities and project 2.
